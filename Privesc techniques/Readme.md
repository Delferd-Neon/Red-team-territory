# Privilege escalation techniques
After attackers and threat actor's getting a shell they try to move further by doing Privilege  escalation. They try many diffent ways of doing this
like Misconfigured binaries, File permissions, missconfigured permissions for normal users, SUID binaries, log rotate, cron jobs etc.
# Types of Privesc (Privilege  Escalation)

There are two types of Privesc:

### Horizontal Privesc
When an attacker gains access to resources or data belonging to another user with the same level of privileges effectively impersonating that user without needing to elevate their privilege level.

### Vertical Privesc
It occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain higher-level privileges than they are authorized to have, typically escalating from a low-privileged user account to an administrator or system-level account.
